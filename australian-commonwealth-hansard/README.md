# Commonwealth Parliamentary Debates (Hansard)

The proceedings of Australia's Commonwealth Parliament are recorded in Hansard, which is available online through the Parliamentary Library's ParlInfo database. This repository includes Jupyter notebooks to harvest and explore XML formatted versions of Hansard. 

Run the notebooks in this repository live on MyBinder â€” just click the button (it might take a little while to load).

You can access a full harvest of the [XML files for both houses between 1901 and 1980 from this repository](https://github.com/wragge/hansard-xml).

The XML files are made available on the Australian Parliament website [under a CC-BY-NC-ND licence](https://www.aph.gov.au/Help/Disclaimer_Privacy_Copyright#c).
